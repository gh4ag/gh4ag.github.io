### Python 

- [Find best overlap between two curves]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/python/curve_overlap/curve_overlap.ipynb %})

### [FreeFem++ class examples](https://gh4ag.github.io/freefem_class_examples/)

FreeFem++ is a finite-element (and finite volume) solver written in C++ with adaptive meshing. See the official [FreeFem++ page](http://www.freefem.org) for more information about the software.<br><br>

My contribution to this project consist in some short examples to show how to embed a user-defined C++ class into FreeFem++ using the right FreeFem++ functions and classes.<br><br>
